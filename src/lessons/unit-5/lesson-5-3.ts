  title: 'Non-Text Contrast for Controls and Graphics',
  description: 'Extend accessible contrast thinking beyond text to the controls, icons, boundaries, and graphics that users depend on to navigate and operate interfaces.',
  learningGoal: 'Identify weak non-text contrast in interface components and improve the visibility of controls, indicators, and meaningful graphics.',

    { id: 's4', text: 'Meaningful icons — icons that carry information, not just decoration — need sufficient contrast to be read reliably. A faint icon telling a user whether a feature is enabled or disabled is a real usability failure.', highlights: ['icon contrast', 'graphical object'] },

  quizItems: [
    { id: 'q1', prompt: 'Does accessibility checking stop once text passes?', choices: [{ id: 'a', label: 'Yes — text is the most important element', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Controls, icons, focus indicators, and graphics also need accessible contrast.' }, { id: 'b', label: 'No — controls, icons, boundaries, and meaningful graphics also need clear visual distinction', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Correct. Text contrast is one part of a complete accessibility check.' }, { id: 'c', label: 'Yes — graphics are decorative', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Meaningful graphics are not decorative and do need contrast.' }, { id: 'd', label: 'Yes — focus states only matter for mobile', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Focus states are most important for keyboard users, not mobile users.' }] },
    { id: 'q2', prompt: 'Why does a visible focus state matter?', choices: [{ id: 'a', label: 'It makes the design look more polished', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Visual polish is a secondary consideration. Function is the primary concern.' }, { id: 'b', label: 'It lets keyboard and assistive technology users track which element is currently active', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Without a visible focus ring, keyboard navigation becomes extremely difficult.' }, { id: 'c', label: 'It improves load performance', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Focus indicators have no impact on load performance.' }, { id: 'd', label: 'Designers prefer visible focus rings aesthetically', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Focus rings are often hidden by designers — this is an accessibility failure, not a preference.' }] },
    { id: 'q3', prompt: 'An icon button indicates whether a setting is enabled or disabled. Its icon has low contrast against the background. Why is this a problem?', choices: [{ id: 'a', label: 'Icons are decorative and do not need contrast', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'This icon carries essential meaning — it is a graphical object, not decoration.' }, { id: 'b', label: 'The icon carries essential meaning and low contrast makes it hard to read, failing users who rely on it', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Correct. Meaningful icons need sufficient contrast to be reliably read.' }, { id: 'c', label: 'Icons only need to be large to be accessible', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Size helps, but contrast is also required.' }, { id: 'd', label: 'The button text label fixes the contrast problem', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'If the button has no text label, the icon IS the content.' }] },
