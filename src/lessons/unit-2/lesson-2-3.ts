      text: 'With paint, mixing more colors absorbs more wavelengths and tends to produce darker, muddier results. With screen color, raising more channels adds more light — the result gets brighter, not muddier. More color on screen moves toward white, not mud.',

        { id: 'b', label: 'RGB channels correspond to the three light sources that displays physically emit.', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Screens control red, green, and blue light. RGB describes that emitted light directly — it is not a convention but a physical fact about display hardware.' },

        { id: 'a', label: 'Nothing — black works the same way on screen as in paint.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'On screen, darkening means reducing channel values, not blending a black pigment in.' },
        { id: 'b', label: 'Screen darkening works by reducing channel values, not mixing pigment.', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'There is no "mixing" of pigment on a screen. Dark screen colors have lower R, G, B values — less light, not more black paint.' },
        { id: 'c', label: 'Black should be avoided in digital design.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Black is a valid screen color. The issue is describing darkening as pigment mixing when it is actually channel reduction.' },

        { id: 'c', label: '"Mixing more screen colors will make the result muddier."', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Muddiness describes pigment mixing. On screen, more active channels add brightness, not mud. This is paint logic applied to the wrong model.' },

    'Screen logic: mixing more light makes colors brighter; combining all primaries at full strength gives white.',

    'Designers who move between print and screen work need to consciously switch models.',
    'Black on a screen is the complete absence of emitted light, not a color mixed from other colors.',
