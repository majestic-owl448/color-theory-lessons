      choices: [
        { id: 'a', label: 'The printer made an error and should be recalibrated.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Printers can be miscalibrated, but the more fundamental reason is that screens emit light while print can only reflect it — some screen colors are outside the print gamut.' },
        { id: 'b', label: 'The screen\'s emitted light cannot be matched by ink reflecting ambient light.', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'This is the core reason. Vivid screen colors often exceed what ink can reflect — the print gamut is narrower than the screen gamut for many saturated colors.' },
        { id: 'c', label: 'Teal is not a printable color.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Teal is printable, but some specific teal values — especially very vivid ones — may fall outside the print gamut.' },
        { id: 'd', label: 'The designer should have used CMYK values on screen.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Screen design uses RGB. The solution is to understand that a gap will exist, not to design in CMYK on a screen.' },

        { id: 'b', label: 'Understanding the subtractive model explains why screen-to-physical gaps exist, which matters whenever work crosses media.', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Even screen-first designers encounter physical color — icons become stickers, brand colors go on merchandise, app colors appear in print. Knowing why the gap exists prevents false expectations.' },
