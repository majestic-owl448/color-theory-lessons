  title: 'Two Ways Color Mixes',
  description: 'Discover the fundamental difference between color made from light and color made from pigment, and unlearn the paint-based intuitions that mislead screen designers.',
  learningGoal: 'Correctly classify common examples as additive or subtractive, explain the difference in plain language, and identify when paint logic is being misapplied to screens.',

  keyPoints: [
    'Screens use additive color: red, green, and blue light are combined to make colors.',
    'Adding all three RGB primaries at full intensity produces white — the presence of all light.',
    'Physical materials use subtractive color: pigments absorb (subtract) wavelengths and reflect the rest.',
    'Mixing all subtractive primaries fully produces black — all wavelengths absorbed.',
    'The two models are opposites: more light is added on screens; more wavelengths are removed in pigments.',
    'Applying paint logic to screens produces wrong predictions — "muddy," "dilute," and "absorb" are paint-model words.',
    'Black on a screen is the complete absence of emitted light, not a color mixed from other colors.',
