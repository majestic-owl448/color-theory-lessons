      prompt: 'A designer uses five different accent colors across a single screen — purple, teal, orange, red, and gold. What is the most likely hierarchy problem?',

        { id: 'b', label: 'No single element has clear primary emphasis.', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'When everything is accented differently, nothing stands out. The eye does not know where to go first.' },
        { id: 'c', label: 'The colors will be hard to distinguish for colorblind users.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'That may also be true, but the primary hierarchy problem is that everything competes equally.' },
        { id: 'd', label: 'The design lacks enough contrast.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Five saturated accents might have plenty of contrast individually — the problem is that none is clearly dominant.' },
      ],

      prompt: 'Which revision best supports a single primary action on a screen?',
      choices: [
        { id: 'a', label: 'Make all buttons the same bright color so they all get attention.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Equal emphasis means no emphasis. The user still cannot tell which action matters most.' },
        { id: 'b', label: 'Use the accent color only for the primary button; make others gray or outlined.', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Reserving the accent for one element immediately signals its importance.' },
        { id: 'c', label: 'Add more colors to make secondary actions more interesting.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'More colors create more visual noise, not clearer hierarchy.' },
        { id: 'd', label: 'Reduce all button contrast so nothing stands out too much.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Reducing all contrast makes every action feel equally unimportant.' },
      ],

      id: 'q3',
      prompt: 'On a well-designed screen, the primary CTA uses the accent color. What should the secondary actions typically look like?',
      choices: [
        { id: 'a', label: 'More saturated than the primary to create balance.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'More saturation would challenge the primary for attention, not support it.' },
        { id: 'b', label: 'Outlined, muted, or text-only — visually subordinate.', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Secondary actions need to be available without competing. Lower contrast and less visual weight keep them supportive.' },
        { id: 'c', label: 'The same color as the primary but smaller.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Same color means the same emphasis signal — size alone does not create enough hierarchy difference.' },
        { id: 'd', label: 'Bright red so users notice there is a secondary option.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Red carries a danger/destructive meaning and would create the wrong signal for a neutral secondary action.' },
