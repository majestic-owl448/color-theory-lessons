      choices: [
        { id: 'a', label: 'Six hues, all equally saturated, used freely throughout.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Equal saturation everywhere and no dominant direction produces a noisy, hierarchy-free design.' },
        { id: 'b', label: 'One dominant hue, one complementary accent, one or two neutrals.', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'A controlled palette with a clear dominant direction and a single intentional accent is easier to keep coherent, especially for beginners.' },
        { id: 'c', label: 'A rainbow of tints so nothing feels too strong.', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Softening everything does not solve the problem — it just removes all hierarchy.' },
