    { id: 's1', text: 'A designer picking a new color for every button, card, and state creates an interface that slowly becomes inconsistent. When the same blue means \'primary action\' on one screen and \'informational note\' on another, users lose confidence.', highlights: ['color system', 'consistency'] },
    { id: 's2', text: 'Unit 3 covered assigning roles in a single interface. Here, the scope expands: a color system governs those roles across many screens, flows, and teams so meaning stays stable product-wide.', highlights: ['semantic role'] },
    { id: 's3', text: 'System-level failures are usually governance failures: one role used for two meanings, two roles used for one meaning, or local overrides that drift from shared tokens. Your job in this unit is to detect and correct those patterns early.' },
    { id: 's4', text: 'A minimal system does not need to be large. Even a compact set of 8–12 roles can support a full product when each role has a clear boundary and change decisions are applied consistently.' },
    { id: 's5', text: 'In the comparison tool, you will see two versions of the same interface: one with ad-hoc color choices, and one with a consistent role-based system. Click the inconsistencies in the ad-hoc version to reveal what broke and why.' },

      choices: [
        { id: 'a', label: 'Hex values are harder to type', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Ease of typing is not the reason semantic roles are used.' },
        { id: 'b', label: 'Semantic roles describe what a color does, making decisions reusable and product-consistent', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Correct. \'action-primary\' tells the whole team what that color is for, regardless of its current hex value.' },

        { id: 'b', label: 'The blue carries too many different meanings — users cannot tell what is interactive and what is decorative', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Correct. When one color does too many jobs, users cannot tell what is interactive and what is purely visual.' },
        { id: 'c', label: 'Blue is not accessible', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Blue can be accessible — the issue here is overuse and mixed meaning, not the hue itself.' },
        { id: 'd', label: 'Decorative elements should always match buttons', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Decorative elements should generally not match interactive elements — that is the source of the problem.' },
