  title: 'Building Semantic Color Roles for UI',
  description: 'Define a compact set of semantic roles covering structure, content, interactions, and status — and connect those roles to real components.',

    { id: 's1', text: 'A useful role set covers four areas: structural (backgrounds, surfaces, dividers), content (primary text, secondary text, inverse text), interactive (primary action, secondary action, focus, links), and semantic (success, warning, error, info).', highlights: ['primary text', 'secondary text', 'semantic status'] },
    { id: 's2', text: 'Text usually needs at least two levels. Primary text is used for headings and important labels. Secondary text is used for supporting information, captions, and metadata. Without this separation, everything fights for attention.' },
    { id: 's3', text: 'Surfaces also need levels: the page background, the card surface on top of it, and sometimes a raised panel on top of the card. Without tonal separation between surfaces, the layout loses depth and visual structure.', highlights: ['elevated surface'] },
    { id: 's4', text: 'Interactive roles need more than a single action color. A button also has hover, focus, pressed, and disabled states. Each needs a clear visual treatment — not just a different hex, but a meaningful role.', highlights: ['component state', 'hover', 'disabled'] },
    { id: 's5', text: 'In the role builder, assign colors to each semantic slot. A live preview shows how your choices affect a card, a button, an alert, and a form field. The tool flags obvious problems like indistinct statuses or weak text hierarchy.' },

      hints: [
        'Start with surfaces and text — get the background and readability right before adding accent colors.',

      choices: [
        { id: 'a', label: 'Contrast rules require it', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'WCAG does not require two text roles — the reasoning is about visual hierarchy.' },
        { id: 'b', label: 'To create hierarchy — primary text draws attention, secondary text supports without competing', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Correct. Two text roles allow information to have weight and hierarchy without every element demanding equal attention.' },
        { id: 'c', label: 'Components need many text colors to look complex', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Complexity is not a goal — clear hierarchy is.' },

        { id: 'b', label: 'Component state treatments — without them users cannot tell whether a button responded to their input', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Correct. States communicate feedback — users need to know when something is being hovered, focused, or is unavailable.' },
