    { id: 's1', text: 'Dark mode is not the inverse of light mode. Inverting light values produces unnatural results: pure black backgrounds feel harsh, pure white text creates intense halation, and surfaces that were separated in light mode may blur together in dark mode.', highlights: ['dark mode', 'light mode', 'theme pairing'] },
    { id: 's2', text: 'Dark theme backgrounds are typically a very dark but not pure-black neutral — something in the range of #0f172a to #1e293b, for example. The exact values will depend on your palette; what matters is avoiding pure black and leaving room for surface layers above it.', highlights: ['surface depth', 'tonal separation'] },
    { id: 's3', text: 'Text in dark mode is usually a soft off-white rather than pure white. As a starting point, primary text might be around #f8fafc while secondary text is around #94a3b8 — still high contrast against the dark surface, but less fatiguing than full-brightness white.', highlights: ['inverse text'] },
    { id: 's4', text: 'Accent colors often need to be lighter or less saturated in dark mode. A vivid blue that read well on a white background may feel overwhelming on a dark surface. Mode adaptation means reviewing each role, not just toggling a switch.', highlights: ['mode adaptation'] },

        { id: 'b', label: 'Inverted colors never pass contrast', isCorrect: false, explanation: 'Inverted colors can pass contrast — but they often fail for structural reasons.' },
        { id: 'c', label: 'Inverted values often collapse surface separation, create harsh extremes, and can break semantic meaning', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'A value that was light on dark may invert to something too similar to another role.' },

        { id: 'b', label: 'Vivid colors appear more intense on dark backgrounds — they can dominate or feel aggressive where they felt balanced in light mode', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Correct. Dark backgrounds amplify perceived saturation, requiring accent colors to be softened.' },

  keyPoints: [
    'Dark mode is not light-mode inversion — surfaces, text, and accents all need intentional dark-theme values.',
    'Use very dark but not pure-black backgrounds (e.g. #0f172a) to allow card and panel layers to appear above.',
    'Text should be soft off-white in dark mode, not pure white, to reduce glare and halation.',
    'Accent colors often need lighter or less-saturated values in dark mode — vivid colors intensify on dark surfaces.',
    'Check contrast in both modes separately — what passes in light mode may fail in dark mode.',
