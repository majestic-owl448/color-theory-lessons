      id: 's2',
      text: 'Designers encounter color values in many places: CSS files, design tool inspectors, browser dev tools, component libraries, and design token files. In all of them, the color is expressed as a specific format — not a feeling, but a number.',

    {
      id: 's3',
      text: 'Three formats are especially common: HEX, RGB, and HSL. You already know RGB as the additive light model from Unit 2, and hue, saturation, and lightness as visible properties from Unit 1. This unit focuses on how those ideas become written color values in code. HEX is compact and common in CSS. RGB notation maps directly to the channel values you practiced. HSL notation matches how designers describe adjustments.',
